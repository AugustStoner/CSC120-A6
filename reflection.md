- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance is a cool concept, and I like how it impacts the workflow of creating similar objects. 
I did not get to a level of error handling in this assignment as I would have liked, which will likely cause issues until I sit down and implement better error handling. 
Partly I think the automatic Hashtable exceptions will cover certain cases, but I have not determined which situations should be handled separately. 
My code is very messy and not well-documented, and I am not satisfied with my ability to prevent future issues by handling extra information in advance, as I typically try to. 
My process for creating algorithms/outlines for the classes in this assignment worked well to keep track of which required attributes and methods I had completed, but I was not able to keep track of as much helpful information to make sure everything worked as well as it could have. 
For someone taking this course in the future, plan to give yourself time to create algorithms and work incrementally, reviewing your work and making sure it is readable and sensible as you go (as I did not do).
