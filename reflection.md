- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance is a cool concept, and I like how it impacts the workflow of creating similar objects. 
My process for creating algorithms/outlines for the classes in this assignment worked well to keep track of which required attributes and methods I had completed, but I was not able to keep track of as much helpful information to make sure everything worked as well as it could have. 
For someone taking this course in the future, plan to give yourself time to create algorithms and work incrementally, reviewing your work and making sure it is readable and sensible as you go (as I did not do). 
I revisited the Library class and implemented try/catch blocks in its methods to better manage cases of trying to add books multiple times, trying to check out or remove a book not in the collection, returning a book that is not checked out, and trying to check out a book that is not available. 
I am happy with the state of the Building subclasses at this point, but I may choose to remove print statements from the Library's error handling at a later point if it gets annoying.
